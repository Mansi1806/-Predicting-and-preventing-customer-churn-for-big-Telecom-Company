# Predicting-and-preventing-customer-churn-for-big-Telco-Companies

Description: 

We are analyzing the Call Detail Record (CDR) of the customers of a big telco service provider and predicting the possible customer churn that can happen in the future, this will help the company understand it's potential revenue loss in the coming time. Further, we will prevent the churning by finding its causes for example frequent call drops, bad network coverage, etc. This will work as a performance monitoring system for the company. And help them to improve their services further and prevent the loss of revenue due to customer churn. 

The main objective of our work is to develop a churn prediction model that helps a telecom service provider to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn. We will be using machine learning techniques on big data that uses a new way of features engineering to predict customer churn.
